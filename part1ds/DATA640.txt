Prerequisite: DATA 630. Introduces fundamental concepts and techniques to discover patterns in data, identify variables with most predictive power and to develop predictive models. Topics include data mining and machine learning concepts and methods: data selection, representation, cleansing and preprocessing; algorithms such as artificial neural networks, classification, clustering and association rules; advanced techniques such as text mining and web mining. Best practices on the selection of methods and tools to build predictive models will also be covered.
