An overview of both the theory of and applications for providing effective security in database management systems. Topics include conceptual frameworks for discretionary and mandatory access control, data integrity, availability and performance, secure database design, data aggregation, data inference, secure concurrency control, and secure transactions processing. Models for multilevel secure databases for both relational and object-relational databases are analyzed. Assignments focus on database security concepts and require use of a remote access laboratory.
