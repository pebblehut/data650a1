An overview of the data mining component of the knowledge discovery process. Data mining applications are introduced, and algorithms and techniques useful for solving different problems are identified. Topics include the application of well-known statistical, machine learning, and database algorithms, including decision trees, similarity measures, regression, Bayes theorem, nearest neighbor, neural networks and genetic algorithms. Discussion also covers researching data mining applications and integrating data mining with data warehouses.
