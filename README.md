# data650a1

This repository is for my first assignment for my UMUC (Univ. of Maryland Univ. College)
course DATA 650 - Big Data Analytics.

Part1 is to follow a tutorial to anlayze the pattern in course descriptions.

Part2 is (or will hopefully be) an analysis of minutes of the Raleigh, NC city council 
committee meetings concerning "Growth and Natural Resources"
