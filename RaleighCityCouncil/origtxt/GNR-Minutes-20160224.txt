GROWTH AND NATURAL RESOURCES COMMITTEEThe Growth and Natural Resources Committee of the City of Raleigh met in regular session on Wednesday, February 24, 2016, at 2:00 p.m. in the City Council Chamber, Room 201, Raleigh Municipal Building, 222 West Hargett Street, Avery C. Upchurch Government Complex, Raleigh, North Carolina, with the following present:Committee							StaffChairperson Kay C. Crowder, Presiding		Assistant City Manager James GreeneCouncilor Bonner Gaylord				Deputy City Attorney Ira BotvinickCouncilor Russ Stephenson				Planner II Doug Hill					Absent and ExcusedCouncilor Dickie Thompson These are summary minutes unless otherwise indicated.Chairperson Crowder called the meeting to order and indicated Mr. Thompson would be absent and excused from today’s meeting.The following item was discussed.Item #15-01 – Z-39-15 – Trailwood Drive Conditional Use District.  This item was previously discussed at the Committee’s January 27, 2016 meeting and held over for further discussion.  Chairperson Crowder read the following statement:* At our meeting on January 26th, the Committee asked the applicant to consider submitting a traffic impact study.* I understand from the staff memo that while a study was submitted to staff on February 17, staff did not have sufficient time to review in advance of this meeting.* While I do not believe that we have sufficient information, as a committee, to engage in further deliberation or to make a recommendation on the case at this meeting, I understand that many in the neighborhood were not able to attend the last meeting.* As a result, I'd like to ask both City staff and the applicant to briefly summarize the key issues for those in attendance so that there is a common understanding prior to our March 9th meeting – I believe that there may be community members that also wish to address the issue.Planner Doug Hill summarized citing the following highlights:Proposed Conditions1. Dwelling units per acre limited (max. 14 per acre).2. Site development restricted to residential uses.3. Transit easement offered.Comprehensive Plan AnalysisConsistent with Future Land Use Map (Moderate Density Residential); no Urban Form designation (Center or Corridor)Consistent policies:• Policy LU 1.2 - Future Land Use Map and Zoning Consistency• Policy LU 1.3 - Conditional Use District Consistency • Policy LU 2.6 - Zoning and Infrastructure Impacts • Policy LU 5.4 - Density Transitions • Policy LU 5.6 - Buffering Requirements • Policy LU 6.4 - Bus Stop Dedication • Policy LU 8.12 - Infill Compatibility• Policy T 4.15 - Enhanced Rider AmenitiesInconsistent policies: (None identified.)Outstanding Issues1. Existing block perimeter exceeds UDO standards.2. Sewer and fire flow matters may need to be addressed upon redevelopment.RecommendationsPlanning Commission: Recommends approval by 7-3 vote.• The proposal is consistent with the Future Land Use Map and applicable policies of the Comprehensive Plan.• The proposed rezoning is reasonable and in the public interest.  Transit services are available; sidewalks, while not continuous to the north or east, exist to the west (along Thistledown Drive) and are being constructed to the south (along Trailwood Drive).  Opportunity for cross-access is limited due to existing grade and transition yards.• The proposal is compatible with the surrounding area.  Height could provide a transition between 3-story apartments to the west, and potential 5-story development to the east, on Centennial Campus.West CAC: Recommends denial (Y- 0, N- 27, on 11/17/15; 2nd vote on 1/19/16: 22 opposed to proposal, 0 in favor)                     Attorney Lacy Reeves, 150 Fayetteville Street, representing the Petitioner, confirmed Planner Hill’s summary and talked about issues discussed at the Committee’s previous meeting including maximum density, the number of 4-bedroom units, tree conservation, etc.  He stated his client is prepared to submit a revised list of proposed conditions that include reducing the maximum density to 12 units per acre, and talked about his client’s proposal to conserve trees along Trailwood Drive pointing out the majority of the conserved trees would be along I-440.  He noted the proposed tree conservation area would allow for 2 ingress/egress points for the subject property.  Mr. Reeves noted his client has prepared a traffic impact analysis (TIA) and has submitted it to Staff for consideration. Chairperson Crowder pointed out a the Committee’s January 27 meeting the Petitioner was going to report at today’s meeting on whether they would be able to prepare a TIA.  She stated Staff would need more time to review the report before making any recommendations.Discussion took place regarding whether there was a deadline for the Petitioner to submit revised conditions.Tom Kwak, 1333 Trailwood Drive, stated he was representing neighbors from the Trailwood Drive community and indicated the Trailwood community was a diverse neighborhood.  He stated the neighbors were not able to attend to the Committee’s January meeting due to a short notice in receiving the Committee agenda.  He stated the neighborhood is zoned primarily Residential-2 with the overlay to maintain the neighborhood’s character.  He talked about how the proposed rezoning would allow building heights greater than any other buildings in the area, and asserted this would be a case of spot zoning and that 4-story buildings on the elevated lot would stand out in the neighborhood.  Mr. Kwak talked about recent efforts to build student housing closer to campus for ease of access and asserted student housing built this far out would be inappropriate.  He stated Trailwood Drive is a 2-lane road with no shoulder and there is no Wolfline transit service to this area.  He indicated he sees no community benefit to the proposed project.  He stated the neighborhood is not opposed to development; however, the proposed site is not appropriate for high-density zoning.  He indicated the neighbors would support R-10 zoning at best for the property, and pointed out the West CAC voted against the proposed rezoning 2 times.7 people stood in support of Mr. Kwak’s statement.Wendell Gilliam, 1129 Trailwood Drive, indicated he has worked with the CAC for a number of years and stated he has not seen spot zoning such as this before.  He talked about how the developer declined efforts to discuss the project with the neighborhood, and went on to talk about traffic and mail delivery issues along Trailwood Drive due to the amount of student-related traffic in the area.Mr. Stephenson questioned when Staff would be prepared to discuss the TIA with Chairperson Crowder indicating the Committee will schedule a meeting for 2 weeks, on March 9, 2016, to discuss the TIA issue.Chairperson Crowder noted the Trailwood Drive bridge was now closed for repairs, and that meant that 2 bridges in the district were now closed.  She talked about traffic issues in the neighborhood due to the bridge closures and indicated the bridge repairs were scheduled to be completed sometime in 2017.Mr. Stephenson indicated the parcel located on the southeast corner of the subject property (1900 Trailwood Drive) is a single family residence and questioned the reason for the Petitioner’s proposal to exclude the parcel from the Parkway Frontage requirement with Attorney Reeves responding the property would receive treatment similar to Parkway Frontage, and went on to talk about how trees would be chosen for conservation purposes.  In response to questions, Attorney Reeves indicated the subject parcel is where the owner of the proposed rezoning lot lives, and has no intention of moving; therefore requests that his lot be excluded from the Parkway Frontage requirement with both Mr. Stephenson and Chairperson Crowder suggesting the Petitioner remove the parcel from the rezoning application.Mr. Stephenson questioned whether the Petitioner considered R-10 density with Attorney Reeves expressing his belief his client’s proposed 12-unit-per-acre density was a good compromise, and asserted spot zoning was not illegal.  He went on to assert the subject lots were not for single family residential development and that the parcel was better suited for medium density development.  Mr. Stephenson pointed out the Future Land Use Map proposes density of 6 to 14 units per acre for the subject property.Attorney Reeves acknowledged that Trailwood Drive was a 2-lane road, and talked briefly about the TIA his client submitted to staff for review.  He asserted the proposed revisions would allow for only 68 units on the property and that that TIA would indicate that traffic increases along Trailwood Drive would be minimal.It was agreed to hold the item in Committee for further discussion with Chairperson Crowder indicating the Committee would next meet on Wednesday, March 9, 2016.Adjournment.  There being no further business, Chairperson Crowder announced the meeting adjourned at 2:42 p.m.Ralph L.
